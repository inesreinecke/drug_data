# drug_data
This repository contains my jupyter lab scripts (python), that have been used for a research project to assess and improve data structure of inpatient drug prescriptions based on ATC. 

It consits of 4 scripts:
(1) algorithm implementation
(2) visulization of Figure 2
(3) t-Test of Levenshtein score mean values for correct versus false results
(4) apply evaluation results to original data set and visualization for the results section of the publication
